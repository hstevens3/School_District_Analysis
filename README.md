# Module 4 Pandas Data Frames

# Pyschool School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

This challenge was exploring data frames, selecting columns or rows and filtering, using summary functions, and aggregate functions in Pandas. I learned a lot of techniques while completing this challenge. The most difficult step for me was Deliverable 5 #2 because I added an extra step to have the column name as student_count to match the output in the starter code. I can see how useful the aggregate functions are, especially being able to specify multiple levels of grouping.
